1. Go through the codebase and try to understand its structure and usage.
2. Add a new page to the application (`/products`) that would display images, their titles, descriptions, prices and images.
  Focus primarily on the layout, no need to worry about colors/backgrounds/etc. (You choose the design)
3. Add a new page to the application (you choose the path) that would display a form which is used to add a new product. The images should have the following properties:
    * a title
    * a description
    * an image (You can omit this and return to it later as **Bonus**)
    * a price
4. Implement the endpoint for creating a new product
5. Bonus: implement the functionality for image uploading (let's assume the images are max. 1MB in size, you can choose any approach you want to send the data)
